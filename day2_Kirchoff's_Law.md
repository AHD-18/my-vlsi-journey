KCL: KCL states that " Total current entering the node will always be equal to the total current leaving it".
It is based on fundamental prinicple of conservation of charges.

KVL: KVL states that "Total voltage supplied by any source in a closed lopp will always be eqaual to the total voltage drop across various elements in that closed loop". 
It is based on fundamental prinicple of energy consevation.

Resistance in Series: R_eq= R_1 + R_2 + R_3 +.........
It is based on the principle that the current is same across all elements when connected in series and the sum of voltage drop across each element will always be equal to total voltage supplied.

Resistance in Parallel: (1/R_eq)= (1/R_1) + (1/R_2) + (1/R_3) +.......
It is based on the principle that the voltgae  is same across all elements when connected in parallel and the sum of current entering any node is always equal to the total current leaving the node.
