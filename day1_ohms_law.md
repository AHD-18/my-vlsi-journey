What is Voltage ?
Amount of work needed to move a unit of charge from one point to another is known as voltage.
It is a push that moves electron through a circuit.
It is usually compared to water pressure . As higher pressure pushes more water through a pipe, higher voltage pushes more charge through a circuit.

What is Current?
Current refers to as the flow of electric charge. It is essentially the rate at which electric charge flow thorugh a conductor.
Similarly like voltage in water analogy , we compre current with the flow of water as flow of electrons.

What is Resistance ?
Resistance is the measure of how much material opposes the flow of electron current.
It could be compared with the obstruction in the water pipe which restrict the flow of water .

Ohm's Law:
Ohm's Law is the relation between resistance , voltage and current.
For comparision , water flow increases when water pressure is more and obstrcution is less ,i.e., current is more when voltage increases and resistance decreases.
